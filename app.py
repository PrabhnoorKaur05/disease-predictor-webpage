**How this model predicts diseases:**  

1. You select symptom categories and symptoms.  
2. The app converts your selection into a format the model understands.  
3. Three models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) predict probabilities for each disease.  
4. A meta-model combines these predictions to give the final result.  
5. The top disease is always shown; a second disease appears only if it is likely.  
6. Predictions are suggestions; always consult a doctor for confirmation.
